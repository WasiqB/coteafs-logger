# Contributing

I appreciate your interest for contributing in enhancing and evolving the coteafs-logger framework.

## 1. Where to start from?

If you've noticed a bug or have a question plesae check the [search the issue tracker][tracker] to see if someone else has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and [add one][new issue]!

## 2. Want to fix an issue or add new feature?

If this is something you think you can fix, then follow the following steps:

### Step 1: Discuss

Before jumping on any ticket or any feature which you think should be there in the framework, discuss with me on my [site][] or email me @ wasbhamla2005@gmail.com. Once you get go-ahead, you can proceed by following the steps mentioned hereafter.

### Step 2: Setup your E-mail in Git

Assuming you have already done this. But if you are new and may forget this, you can do it as described [here][setup].

### Step 3: Fork and clone coteafs-logger

To Fork **coteafs-logger** and clone it, see this useful [post][fork].

### Step 4: Create new Branch

Now create a new branch with descriptive name in your forked repo. Refer [here][branch] to know about Git branches.

### Step 5: Commit with a descriptive message

If committing a fix for a ticket, always start with `Fixed #[Ticket ID]` than describe the changes in detail.
For an example on how to write a proper commit message, see [this][commitHelp] post.

### Step 6: Push changes to your cloned fork

After committing the changes, you need to push the commit to your cloned repo by executing `git push origin your-branch-name` command in the terminal.

### Step 7: Send Pull Request

Sending Pull Request will be the last step of your contribution. To know how to raise a PR, see [this][pr] post.

> **NOTE:** From your second contribution onwards, you can skip steps **(1) and (2)**.
